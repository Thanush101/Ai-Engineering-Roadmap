# AI Engineering Roadmap

This repository is an ongoing collection of AI and Machine Learning implementations, serving as a practical learning path for AI Engineering. The content is regularly updated with new examples and lessons.

üöß **Work in Progress**: More lessons and code examples are being added regularly!

## Contents

- Python implementations in `codes/`
- Documentation and tutorials in `lessons/`


## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thanush101/Ai-Engineering-Roadmap.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv virtualEnv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# On Windows
virtualEnv\Scripts\activate

# On Unix or MacOS
source virtualEnv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r codes/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each Python file in the `codes` directory contains standalone examples that can be run independently. Make sure to have the required dependencies installed and the virtual environment activated.

For example, to run the content recommendation system:
```bash
python codes/content_recommendation.py
```
